# GoScript Framework Roadmap

This document outlines the strategic roadmap for GoScript framework development, focusing on enhancing its capabilities as a high-performance frontend framework with seamless backend integration.

## Core Components Roadmap

### 1. GoSky - Advanced Rendering System

GoSky will be our comprehensive rendering solution that prioritizes performance across all rendering approaches.

**Features:**
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** - Optimized for initial page load performance
- **Edge Rendering** - Distributed rendering at CDN edge locations
- **Streaming Rendering** - Progressive content delivery for improved perceived performance
- **Client-side Hydration** - Seamless takeover of server-rendered content
- **AI-powered Predictive Rendering** - Pre-rendering content based on predicted user actions
- **WebAssembly Rendering** - High-performance rendering using WASM
- **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)** - Combining static generation with dynamic updates

**Implementation Priority:**
1. Core SSR engine with hydration
2. Edge rendering capabilities
3. Streaming rendering
4. WASM rendering optimization
5. ISR implementation
6. Predictive rendering system

**Performance Metrics:**
- Time to First Byte (TTFB) < 50ms
- First Contentful Paint (FCP) < 1s
- Time to Interactive (TTI) < 2s
- Hydration completion < 100ms

### 2. GoConnect - Advanced Authentication and Authorization System

GoConnect will provide a comprehensive authentication and authorization system with granular access control and multiple authentication methods.

**Features:**

- **Form State Management** - Comprehensive form handling utilities
- **Validation System** - Client-side validation with backend validation integration
- **State Persistence** - Optional persistence for state recovery
- **Change Tracking** - Efficient tracking of state changes
- **Optimistic Updates** - Support for optimistic UI updates

**Implementation Priority:**
1. Core state management system
2. Form handling utilities
3. Validation framework
4. Change tracking system
5. Optimistic updates
6. State persistence

### 4. GoBuild - High-Performance Build System

GoBuild will provide a next-generation build system designed specifically for GoScript applications.

**Features:**
- **Zero-Configuration Builds** - Works out of the box with sensible defaults

2. Development server with HMR
3. Incremental build system
4. Asset processing pipeline
5. Advanced optimization features
6. Build analysis tools

### 5. GOPM Enhancements - Development Tools

Enhance GOPM to provide a superior developer experience for frontend development.

**Features:**
- **Project Scaffolding** - Templates for different project types
- **Package Management** - Dependency management for GoScript projects
- **Command Line Interface** - Unified CLI for all GoScript tools
- **Testing Utilities** - Comprehensive testing framework
- **Performance Monitoring** - Built-in performance metrics

**Implementation Priority:**
1. Enhanced project scaffolding
2. Package management system
3. Unified CLI architecture
4. Testing framework integration
5. Performance monitoring tools

## Future Considerations
