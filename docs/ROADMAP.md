# GoScript Framework Roadmap

This document outlines the strategic roadmap for GoScript framework development, focusing on enhancing its capabilities as a high-performance frontend framework with seamless backend integration.

## Core Components Roadmap

### 1. GoSky - Advanced Rendering System

GoSky will be our comprehensive rendering solution that prioritizes performance across all rendering approaches.

**Features:**
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** - Optimized for initial page load performance
- **Edge Rendering** - Distributed rendering at CDN edge locations
- **Streaming Rendering** - Progressive content delivery for improved perceived performance
- **Client-side Hydration** - Seamless takeover of server-rendered content
- **AI-powered Predictive Rendering** - Pre-rendering content based on predicted user actions
- **WebAssembly Rendering** - High-performance rendering using WASM
- **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)** - Combining static generation with dynamic updates

**Implementation Priority:**
1. Core SSR engine with hydration
2. Edge rendering capabilities
3. Streaming rendering
4. WASM rendering optimization
5. ISR implementation
6. Predictive rendering system

**Performance Metrics:**
- Time to First Byte (TTFB) < 50ms
- First Contentful Paint (FCP) < 1s
- Time to Interactive (TTI) < 2s
- Hydration completion < 100ms

### 2. GoConnect - Backend Integration System

GoConnect will provide standardized, high-performance connectors to popular backend frameworks.

**Features:**
- **Plugin Framework** - Extensible system for backend framework integration
- **Framework-specific Adapters** - Optimized connectors for Django, WordPress, Beego, etc.
- **Authentication System** - Comprehensive auth with granular RBAC
- **Security Layer** - Built-in protection against common vulnerabilities

**Authentication & Access Control:**
- Cell-level dynamic granular access control
- Time-based access restrictions
- Role-based access control
- Request/approval workflow
- Scenario-based access rules
- Temporary delegated access
- Level-based matrix access
- Time-to-action (TAT) based access
- Anomaly detection and prevention

**Implementation Priority:**
1. Plugin framework architecture
2. Django integration adapter
3. WordPress integration adapter
4. Beego integration adapter
5. Core authentication system
6. Advanced RBAC implementation

### 3. GoStore - State Management System

GoStore will provide a high-performance state management solution optimized for form handling and interactive elements.

**Features:**
- **In-memory Data Collection** - Efficient data storage and retrieval
- **Form State Management** - Comprehensive form handling utilities
- **Validation System** - Client-side validation with backend validation integration
- **State Persistence** - Optional persistence for state recovery
- **Change Tracking** - Efficient tracking of state changes
- **Optimistic Updates** - Support for optimistic UI updates

**Implementation Priority:**
1. Core state management system
2. Form handling utilities
3. Validation framework
4. Change tracking system
5. Optimistic updates
6. State persistence

### 4. GOPM Enhancements - Development Tools

Enhance GOPM to provide a superior developer experience for frontend development.

**Features:**
- **Project Scaffolding** - Templates for different project types
- **Hot Module Replacement** - Fast development feedback loop
- **Build Optimization** - Production build optimization
- **Development Server** - Integrated development server
- **Testing Utilities** - Comprehensive testing framework
- **Performance Monitoring** - Built-in performance metrics

**Implementation Priority:**
1. Enhanced project scaffolding
2. Development server with HMR
3. Build optimization tools
4. Testing framework integration
5. Performance monitoring tools

## Future Considerations

### GoSkin - Template System

While not part of the initial focus, GoSkin will be developed as a separate but natively integrated template system.

**Potential Features:**
- Platform-specific templates (web, mobile, 2D, 3D, VR)
- Component library
- Theme system
- Animation framework
- Accessibility features
